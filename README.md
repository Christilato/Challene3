Password Generator: modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected.

The purpose of this project was to create an application that enables a user to generate a random password that meets a set of predefined criteria for number of characters, inclusion of upper case letters, inclusion of lower case letters, inclusion of special characters, and inclusion of numbers. The goal was to write that application so that the user would be required specify a number of characters between 8 and 128, then confirm at least one of the other criteria to be included in their randomly generated password.

Working from starter code that included very basic HTML and CSS files, I used javascript to power the application in the browser. I used a variety of different tools to execute this project including: functions, if/else if/else statements, and for loops.
